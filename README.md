# LeetCode-Solutions

Any problems that I solve on LeetCode will be stored here in case anyone is interested in seeing how I solved them.

I decided to try and solve at least 1 LeetCode problem a day to increase my efficiency when it comes to programming.

By the time I am done uploading to this repository I hope to at least have an internship or a job ðŸ˜‚.
